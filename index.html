    <h3>Lake Kawaguchi, Yamanashi - Japan</h3>
    <p>I wanna visit this place because it looks super peaceful, especially with Mt. Fuji and all the cherry blossoms around. I like how calm the lake is and how the view just feels really relaxing. It seems like a nice spot to chill and take some photos.</p>

  <div class="travel-card">
    <img src="2.jpg" alt="Place 2">
    <h3>Zermatt - Switzerland</h3>
    <p>I want to visit Zermatt because the place looks really cool and peaceful, especially with all the snow and the mountains around it. I like how the town lights up at night, and the view of the Matterhorn looks amazing. It also seems like a fun spot whether it’s summer or winter, since there’s a lot of things you can do there. I just feel like it’s a nice place to experience something different and enjoy the scenery.</p>

  <div class="travel-card">
    <img src="3.jpg" alt="Place 3">
    <h3>Sete Cidades, Azores - Portugal</h3>
    <p>I want to visit this place because the view looks super relaxing and the lakes are really beautiful. I like how the water is so clear and the whole area is full of green mountains and plants. It feels like a perfect spot to just enjoy nature and take a break from noisy places. It also looks fun to walk around or explore the surroundings. I think it’s one of those places that would feel really peaceful in real life.</p>
